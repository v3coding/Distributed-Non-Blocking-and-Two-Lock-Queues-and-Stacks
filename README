Distributed Systems Project
Implemented one lock and two lock and lockless queues as well as one lock stack

Completed by me : Implementations of aforementioned queues and stacks in 

non_blocking_queue.h 
one_lock_queue.h 
two_lock_queue.h
one_lock_stack.h

All work as intended,

Implementations of note are the non blocking queue, 

Which works on a distributed system by utilizing the unused bits in a pointer as a counter to validate 
that the element that you are intending to pop or push is the correct element, even on a distributed system
with no syncrhonization (this is very cool and non trivial)

This is a pretty awesome alogrithm, documented by Maged M. Michael Michael L. Scott
from the university of Rochester in this paper https://www.cs.rochester.edu/~scott/papers/1996_PODC_queues.pdf
